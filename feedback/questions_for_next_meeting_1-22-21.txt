    - Talked about Rt and difficulties with measuring it
    * method right now is okay, the issue I ran into where the susceptible population is significantly lower is valid and we are unsure how to approach it
    * current method only looks at generation 1 -> 2 infection transfers
]
Q1: Should I include exogenous cases in Rt calculations?
    * Rt = exclusive infections from Gen1 -> Gen2?
    OR
    * Rt = infections from Gen1 -> Gen2? + exogenous cases in Gen2 period of time

Scratch notes for true Rt -> infection rate calculation:
Rt = beta * 

How should I handle float values from exponential distribution?
* Round?    -> would lead to a fair amount of 0s = e.g. instant state transfer from susceptible -> exposed -> infected
* Ceiling?  -> would lead to an overestimate and likely a higher mean than the actual mean the distrib. was made with

Should we use a geometric distribution instead?
* https://stackoverflow.com/a/24396275/13789724
* seems identical to exponential distrib., just discrete instead of continuous

===> exp./geo. distribution is just bad for this, maybe use normal instead
what is stdev???

error with Paltiel paper on page 3 parameter table?:
    rate of symptom development does not depend on R0/Rt in the src code

still need Fall data to be able to set parameters and compare model to
