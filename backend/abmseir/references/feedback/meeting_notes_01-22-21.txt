    - Talked about Rt and difficulties with measuring it
    * method right now is okay, the issue I ran into where the susceptible population is significantly lower is valid and we are unsure how to approach it

Q1: Should I include exogenous cases in Rt calculations?
    * Rt = exclusive infections from Gen1 -> Gen2?
    OR
    * Rt = infections from Gen1 -> Gen2? + exogenous cases in Gen2 period of time

Scratch notes for true Rt -> infection rate calculation:
Rt = beta * 

How should I handle float values from exponential distribution?
* Round?    -> would lead to a fair amount of 0s = e.g. instant state transfer from susceptible -> exposed -> infected
* Ceiling?  -> would lead to an overestimate and likely a higher mean than the actual mean the distrib. was made with

Should we use a geometric distribution instead?

* seems identical to exponential distrib., just discrete instead of continuous

Notes:

- Keep track of % of original edges rewired [DONE]
- 1A) Do this as a control - make sure cases line up well with Patiel
- 1D) Methodology:
    * infected [a]symptomatic behavior is really weird and arbitrary - try to match up with Patiel/SEIR model (1A)
    * include parallel simulations with new (UK) strain -> (1.3)*infection_rate or (1.7)*infection_rate
    * population numbers increasing
        - fall, we had 700-800 on campus.
        - spring, we will have around 1000 on campus.

            * math dept. covid dashboard - lots of data to compare fall semester to

- When talking about Se -> SIa, don't move all guaranteed on day 3 (mean = 3).
    * Exponential distribution (mean = 1/lambda)
    * TODO: look into making most if not all aspects of state diagram into this exp. dist.
        - how does SEIR model do it? Grab their numbers and their (effective?) state diagram and use that
