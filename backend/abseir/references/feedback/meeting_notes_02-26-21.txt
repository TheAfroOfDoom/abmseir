Discussion Points:

* Paltiel only has Susceptible/InfectedAsymp. individuals being tested. Should we test all individuals?

aidan notes
* gui is very basic but provides a template to move forward, functionality easier to implement through GUI (user friendly etc.)
* sim provides the framework
* gui provides functionality
* curious about goals in general
* we should setup an agile relationship - user defines needs, dev fits to needs

Notes:

- meeting saturday, having deadline -> work faster

- technical stuff:
    - (jordan idea) add ability to define curves for parameters that tool will pass into `update_parameters()` automatically
        - he specifically asked for something similar to this, glad we took OOP approach and can just pass new params to `update_parameters()` mid-way through simulation. our setup is really good for this
    - allow us to increase exogenous rates as the semester continues, likely give a more accurate model
    - Question: [* Paltiel only has Susceptible/InfectedAsymp. individuals being tested. Should we test all individuals?]
        - we (UMassD) do not test Recovered people since they will always test positive after having it
    - quarantine in fall was likely for 14 days but should ask someone in Health Services to be sure
        - CDC updated to 10 days
    - unsure about how to deal with odd degree'd ring lattice generation, but not really important tbh
        - calculate more accurate ratio of commuters:residents from fall data
        - if we want to have different node types (commuter vs residents), how to generate graph?
            - start with two distinct rings w/different k, link them together?
            - not worth thinking about right now

- our model is an "agent-based"/"individual-based" model
    - will be interesting to be able to add individual behaviors, e.g. mask wearing, social distancing, changing individual transmission rates

- focus on getting GUI to a workable spot by friday/saturday (deadline for meeting)
    - getting data over multiple runs - input sample size
    - expand settable parameters
    - not worth training him on how to modify code and run `main.py`, just make the GUI usable
    - summarized what the Agile framework was -> more frequent meetings so he can tell us what he likes about GUI and we then change it.
        - probably weekly meetings

- model validation
    - continue to try to match with paltiel
    - try to match with fall data -> good to compare real data with to see if SWN model is better than complete graph
    - calculate weekly cases - good value to see model accuracy
    - very important to track isolation/quarantine curve - knowing peak so that Health Services knows how many rooms we'd need for quarantining
    - look at Paltiel paper for more specific values to compare to
    - current spring data seems like 3x higher case rate than fall data.
        - play with params to see if we can match this? i'm thinking it might be an exogneous thing since surrounding rates in community are higher [citation needed]
    - if we still need this by next fall, can see effect of vaccines
        - likely won't be an effect on current semester since Massachusetts estimates give May-July for general population (of which students are within)
        - can modify the following params to see vaccine effect:
            - give individual nodes vaccinations
            - change Rt overall

- funding: he reached out to someone and process will likely start soon (yay)

- long term, publish tool publically
    - good to have donation system so that anyone can use it but they can donate to us if feeling generous
    - publically available - great for resumes and demo-ing what we made to recruiters etc.
